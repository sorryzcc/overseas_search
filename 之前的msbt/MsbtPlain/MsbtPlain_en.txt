胜负判定：率先得到500分的一方获胜

排位赛是决定玩家段位的比赛，以赛季的形式展开。
在赛季期间到达一定的段位时，玩家可依该段位获得相应的奖励。

关于组队：
玩家可以独自参加排位赛，也可以与其他玩家一起组成2人、3人、或5人的队伍参加排位赛。
※组队参加排位赛时，在2人、3人的队伍中，队友之间最多只能相差1个段位；在5人的队伍中，队友之间最多只能相差2个段位。

如何提高段位：
在排位赛对战中获胜可获得♦。当♦集满后，再次赢得1场对战即可提升阶位。当阶位达到最高后，再次满足阶位提升条件时则会提升段位。段位提升后，阶位将变为当前段位下的最低阶。

段位降低时：
在排位赛对战中失败后会失去♦（新手段位的玩家除外）。当失去所有♦后，若再次输掉1场对战则会降低阶位。当阶位降到最低后，再次满足阶位降低条件时则会降低段位。段位降低后，阶位将变为当前段位下的最高阶位。
※大师段位的玩家不会再掉到专家段位。在大师段位下，赢下排位赛的对战时会增加大师段位积分，失败时则会减少大师段位积分。

关于活跃点数：
若活跃点数达到最高，在排位赛对战结束时，可以额外获得♦。

关于活跃点数对段位降低的保护：
当获得的活跃点数超过进度条中的白线位置时，若满足了段位降低的条件，则会扣除相应的活跃点数并保持当前段位。

关于活跃点数对失去♦时的保护：
当获得的活跃点数超过进度条中的白线位置时，若满足了失去♦的条件，则会扣除相应的活跃点数并阻止本次失去♦。

活跃点数的获取方式：
1.连胜2场及以上
2.对局内得分50以上
3.无挂机行为
4.每日首次胜利
5.每日首次组队参与排位赛
6.对局表现优异

关于征召模式：
1.当玩家达到大师段位后，会开启征召模式，在征召模式中，对战双方需要禁用和轮流选择宝可梦，且单局内已选择的宝可梦将不能够重复选择。
2.开启征召模式后，同步开启想玩的的宝可梦，可在选将界面展示。
3.征召模式需要训练家拥有足够的宝可梦才可参与，不过宝可梦不够多的训练家也不必担心，系统会给这部分训练家借用宝可梦以供参与征召模式。

Aeos energy used for energy rewards can be collected by participating in random matches and other battles. For every 100 units of energy you collect, you can make one exchange using the energy reward system, and you can receive one reward for each exchange you make. Setting up an energy boost tank in the energy reward system will allow you to collect more energy.
Additionally, you can make one exchange per day at no energy cost after your first log-in. No-cost exchanges cannot be carried over to the following day, so make sure to use them as soon as possible. 

Maximum Energy:
There is a limit to how much energy you can collect each week. Once you reach the maximum weekly energy for a given week, you will not collect more energy even if you participate in more battles.
Energy held in extra-energy tanks does not count toward your weekly energy limit.

Maximum Energy Rewards:
You can only receive up to 30 energy rewards per day, excluding the reward obtained from the daily no-cost exchange.

Battle Time: 10 Minutes

Ranked matches are battles with seasons where individual players are ranked. During a season, players who reach certain ranks can receive rewards based on the rank reached.

Team Composition:
Players can participate in ranked matches solo. They may also form teams of two, three, or five (including themselves) to participate.
(When participating with a team, please keep the rank difference between teammates to a maximum of one in teams of two or three and to a maximum of two in teams of five.)

Rank Increases:
Winning a ranked match awards the player ♦s. When the player has a full set of ♦s, winning one more battle will increase their rank class. If the player is at the highest class for their rank and wins a battle with these conditions met, their rank itself will increase by one. When a player’s rank increases, their class will become the lowest class for their new rank.

Rank Decreases:
At all ranks other than Beginner, players will lose ♦s when they lose a ranked match. If a player loses a match when they have no ♦s, their rank class will decrease. If they are at the lowest class for their rank when they lose with these conditions met, their rank itself will decrease by one. When a player’s rank decreases, their class will become the highest class for their new rank.
(Class and rank decreases do not apply to Master rank.)

Performance Points:
Each time a player completes a ranked match, they earn performance points (if a player is deemed to have been idling in battle, they will not earn performance points). Earning the maximum amount of performance points will award the player a ♦. Scoring a large number of points during a match, building up a long win streak, and other factors will allow the player to earn more performance points.

Performance Points for Rank Decrease Prevention:
If a player’s amount of performance points is past the gauge’s white line when the player’s rank is about to decrease, performance points may be deducted to prevent a decrease in rank.

Performance Points for ♦ Loss Prevention:
If a player’s amount of performance points is past the gauge’s white line when the player is about to lose a ♦, performance points may be deducted to prevent the loss of the ♦.

Master Rank:
Master rank players will have their Master rank rating increased when they win ranked matches and decreased when they lose.

When a player’s rank decreases, their class will become the highest class for their new rank.
(Players with no ♦s in Great: Class 5, Expert: Class 5, Veteran: Class 5, and Ultra: Class 5 will not experience a class decrease even if they lose with insufficient performance points.)
(Class and rank decreases do not apply to Master rank.)

Performance Points:

Master Rank:
Master rank players will have their Master rank rating increased when they win ranked matches and decreased when they lose.

These ally Pokémon can also warp back to where the large ring was created.
An intact ally forward goal zone can also be designated as the location where the large ring is created. Creating the ring on the forward goal zone of the top path will also create a ring on the forward goal zone of the bottom path, and vice versa. All ally Pokémon, including Hoopa, can use these rings to warp between the two goal zones, and their movement speed will be increased for a short time after warping. After an ally Pokémon warps, there is a set cooldown before that ally can use these rings again.

You can claim your daily Aeos gems and other UNITE Club membership benefits only on the version of the game you used to become a member—either the Nintendo Switch version or the mobile version.

Some membership benefits, including daily Aeos gems and trial Holowear, can only be accessed on the version of the game you used to become a member. However, items received as a UNITE Club membership benefit, such as standard Holowear and Trainer fashion items, can be accessed on either version.

You can use the benefits immediately after becoming a member. The update time for each is as follows:
• Additional trial Unite licenses: every Monday
• Trial Holowear: every Monday
• Holowear of the month: first day of every month

The Holowear of the month from the month you started your membership can be used right away after logging in to the game. The Holowear of the month of the following month can be used starting the first day of that month if your UNITE Club membership is still active.

2. Automatic membership renewal
Depending on your country, region, and age, after you become a UNITE Club member, your membership may be renewed automatically every month.

When playing the mobile version, please log in with the same device used to start your UNITE Club membership. Automatic renewal may not occur if you log in with a different device.

If your membership is set to automatically renew and you do not want it to renew automatically, please cancel the automatic renewal on the platform you used to become a member at least 48 hours (Nintendo Switch) or 24 hours (mobile) before the end of the current billing period.
Even after you’ve stopped the automatic renewal of your membership, you can still claim the current period’s membership benefits.
If you stop your membership’s renewal, your membership will automatically end when the membership period ends.

You can still use items or Aeos gems that you obtained while you were a member even after your membership ends.

If you are using the same account to play the mobile version and the Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon UNITE, you can become a UNITE Club member on only one of the two versions at a time.
